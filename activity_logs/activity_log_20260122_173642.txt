[2026-01-22 17:37:09] [ERROR] Chrome remote debugging is not enabled!

The 'Connect for Recording' feature requires Chrome to be started with remote debugging.

OPTION 1 - Enable Remote Debugging (for full recording):
1. Close ALL Chrome windows completely (check Task Manager)
2. Open Command Prompt (cmd) as Administrator
3. Run this command:
   "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222

   OR if Chrome is in a different location:
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222

4. Chrome will open with remote debugging enabled
5. Then click 'Connect for Recording' again

OPTION 2 - Use 'Send URL to Browser' (no setup needed):
For simple URL navigation without recording, use the 'Send URL to Browser' button instead.

Connection error: <urlopen error timed out>
